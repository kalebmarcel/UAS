Readme2: Unit Testing


---- Encrypted Chat ----

To test the code, you need to have the be able to run the Java app.

When the code is running the CMD will run. You need to select which computer is "The Server" or "The Client" (Note : you need set the the compuer's IP before you run this app). 
Then you can test the app by putting input for chat.

OPTIONS :
1. Server
 or
2. Client

If you select the server, you must run the server before the client is running the app.
After that you can chat each other, However if you select this option your chat will not be encrypted.

If you select the client, you must know the server's IP (you can change it in the code).
After that you can each other, and the Client's chat will be encrypted to the server automatically.

---- Algorithms -----
HOW TO TEST:

The program outputs are the chat itself.

We create the encrypted chat based on the simple Caesar Cipher to encrypt the chat.
